# wkhtmltopdfGUI
A rudimentary GUI for Windows Users to use wkhtmltopdf [requires wkhtmltopdf installed on windows already]
wkhtmltopdf website: http://wkhtmltopdf.org/
wkhtmltopdf github link: https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/wkhtmltopdf

This Windows App only calls wkhtmltopdf from a GUI

I have included the code in wkhtmltopdfCaller.vb file which is Visual Basic Code and can be compiled directly on Windows which has "Microsoft (R) Visual Basic Compiler version 14.0.1038 for Visual Basic 2012" Compiler pre-installed
To compile "wkhtmltopdfCaller.vb" simply type in DOS Command Prompt "vbc htmltopdf.vb"
If you want to include icon then use command "vbc /win32icon:htmlpdf.ico htmltopdf.vb"

This is just a rudimentary GUI for windows users and the code here is written in very rough way (just to accomplish the task anyways) and contains no documentation So unless you really wanna mess with spaghetti you shouldn't take this project as base.
